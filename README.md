# Metamind Roam

### This is a plugin to help you track your activity on your Roam Graph. With every cycle of (1/2) Generate Update Log, Edit Update Log as per your Liking [[M/Update Logs]] and then (2/2) Sync Graph, you get a report of what work you did after every creative bout. In V1, it serves you all the New, Modified and Renamed Pages, since last sync.

**READ THIS BEFORE USE**

**After you install the plugin, Copy a Roam API Token from the Graph Tab, and paste it and Sync the Graph. Now you can go about doing your work in your graph, and whenever you want to generate a report of the work you did, hit the STEP 1:**
  
- STEP 1 is to click the Generate New Update Log and Index Page button to create an Index Page and Update Log page in your Graph.
- STEP 2 is to edit the generated Update Log to capture, with all your comments, the work you did on your graph.
- Then STEP 3 is to Sync Graph with Metamind Servers button to send us graph in it’s latest state.

And so, you can start making changes to your graph : add pages, modify pages and rename pages. And whenever you want to pause and see a log of all the updates you have made, repeat Step 1, 2 and 3 and so on you go...

### CONCEPT OF METAMIND PLUGIN

At Metamind, we realise that it’s better to pause and catalogue an overall picture of the work you have done into your graph in the latest sprint. This is better than simply getting a mindless stream of all updates, of every little movement that happened in your graph. And hence, we have created this plugin for you to generate reports of the work you have created at meaningful intervals you choose.

### ABOUT METAMIND COMPANY

We recognise that Roam Graphs are becoming the industrial units for writers across the world, and we are introducing this plugin to not only track your work, but we are also coming out with an app to share your work with an audience of subscribers who will follow along your updates at meaningful intervals. **To learn more about the Metamind company, check out our website: https://www.metamind.network/**
